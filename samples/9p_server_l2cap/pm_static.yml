# Defines flash layout for L2CAP server with LittleFS (no bootloader)
# Only define fixed partitions - PM will place app in the remaining gap

# No MCUboot - app starts at 0x0 for simpler development

# LittleFS storage for BBS - 128KB
# Using the default littlefs_storage name that PM auto-creates
littlefs_storage:
  address: 0xD0000
  size: 0x20000  # 128KB for BBS
